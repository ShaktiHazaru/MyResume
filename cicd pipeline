I have deployed myresume using a docker container by automating the deployment. 

Below are the steps that I have used to complete the automation. 
  
STEP 1: START THE EC2 MACHINE ON AWS, INSTALL GIT, DOCKER AND JENKINS. For this I have used t2.large with 20gb volume. 

use this link to install jenkins on aws : https://www.jenkins.io/doc/tutorials/tutorial-for-installing-jenkins-on-AWS/

Once docker and jenkins are installed run

systemctl enable docker
systemctl enable jenkins

systemctl start docker
systemctl start jenkins

check the status
systemctl status docker
systemctl status jenkins

STEP2: PROVIDE JENKINS ACCESS TO DOCKER

For Jenkins user to create docker container and run docker images, we need to provide access by running below commands.

usermod -aG docker jenkins

STEP3: SETUP JENKINS USER AND CREATE PIPELINE. 

a. copy the password from /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword and use that for initial setup. 
b. install plugins
c. setup username and password. 
d. create pipeline, use freestyle project. 

STEP4: CONFIGURING PIPELINE 

a. Source Code Management - git
